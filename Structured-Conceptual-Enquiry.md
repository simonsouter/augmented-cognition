# Structured Conceptual Inquiry

---

### Purpose

**Structured Conceptual Inquiry** offers a set of **guidelines** for conducting structured, iterative, human-led inquiry that makes effective use of large language models (LLMs).  
It outlines a practical process for developing understanding through four recurring **phases** — *Framing → Foundation → Inference → Integration and Synthesis* — each designed to support collaboration between human reasoning and LLM-based analysis, while keeping the human in conceptual control.

The framework provides a clear, usable structure rather than a grand architecture. It focuses on maintaining clarity, coherence, and traceability in reasoning while drawing on LLM capabilities for research, exploration, and synthesis.

## I. Phases of Structured Conceptual Inquiry

### 1. Framing Phase — Establishing Conceptual Space

**Purpose:** To clarify the scope and intent of inquiry without closing it off too early.

**LLM Support:**  
- Helps surface related ideas and alternative framings.  
- Provides background knowledge and conceptual contrasts to test assumptions.  
- Suggests boundary adjustments or focus points for the human to evaluate.  

**Human Role:**  
- Chooses and refines the direction of inquiry.  
- Ensures framing remains relevant, coherent, and fit for purpose.  

**Output:** A clear and balanced definition of the inquiry focus to guide the next phases.

### 2. Foundation Phase — Establishing Contextual and Evidential Grounding

**Purpose:** To gather and organize well-founded knowledge that gives the inquiry a stable base.

**Role in the Overall Process:**  
- Serves as the **input substrate** for *Inference* and *Integration and Synthesis*, ensuring that reasoning builds on validated material.  
- Provides **contextual and evidential grounding** through knowledge synthesis and LLM-assisted context engineering.  
- Does not define its internal operations here — those are detailed in the document *Foundational Phase — Canonical Concept (v3).*  

**Output:** Foundational summaries or representations that supply the inquiry with a clear and dependable starting point.

### 3. Inference Phase — Developing Understanding

**Purpose:** To reason, explore, and form new insights by working systematically with the established foundation.

**LLM Support:**  
- Acts as a **cognitive amplifier**: identifies patterns, builds analogies, and helps generate tentative explanations.  
- Assists in linking concepts and testing coherence across different sources or perspectives.  

**Human Role:**  
- Guides exploration, judges plausibility, and filters weak or speculative inferences.  
- Keeps emerging insights connected to the foundational base.  

**Output:** Tentative models, insights, or hypotheses grounded in both evidence and reasoning.

### 4. Integration and Synthesis Phase — Consolidating and Communicating Understanding

**Purpose:** To bring together results, reconcile perspectives, and express what has been learned in clear, coherent form.

**LLM Support:**  
- Summarizes and cross-maps information from different threads of inquiry.  
- Supports structural alignment, comparison, and reconciliation of ideas.  
- Helps draft frameworks, taxonomies, or principle sets for human review.  

**Human Role:**  
- Validates conceptual coherence and resolves tensions between perspectives.  
- Refines meaning and final presentation of integrated results for communication or reuse.  

**Output:** Frameworks, summaries, or structured representations capturing integrated understanding.

## II. Process Logic — Human–LLM Collaboration as a Working Method

Structured Conceptual Inquiry functions as an **iterative process** for coordinated human–LLM reasoning:
