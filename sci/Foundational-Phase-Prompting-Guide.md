# Foundational Phase — Prompting Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides practical, user-facing guidance for conducting the **Foundational Phase** of Structured Conceptual Inquiry (SCI) using large language models (LLMs). It translates the conceptual principles of the Foundational Phase into a series of prompting strategies, reflection cues, and control techniques.

The focus is on supporting **epistemic control** — helping the practitioner steer the model effectively to build structured understanding, not just generate text.

## Core Orientation

During the Foundational Phase, the goal is to **clarify, organize, and consolidate** knowledge from existing sources to create a stable conceptual foundation. The process alternates between two modes:

* **Expansion:** Exploring, gathering, and diversifying perspectives and literature.
* **Consolidation:** Compressing, abstracting, and structuring that information into coherent, integration-ready form.

A good foundational inquiry maintains balance — expanding until conceptual variety is sufficient, then consolidating toward clarity.

## Prompting Strategies

### 1. Context Establishment

Use prompts that set focus and boundaries early:

* “Summarize key theories that define the conceptual space of [topic].”
* “Identify major debates or schools of thought within [domain].”
* “List key concepts and how they interrelate within [field].”

### 2. Expansion (Discovery Mode)

Encourage the model to surface diverse, high-quality sources and ideas:

* “Survey the main conceptual frameworks applied to [topic].”
* “Expand on less dominant perspectives or emerging approaches.”
* “What models, definitions, or mechanisms recur across disciplines when describing [concept]?”

### 3. Consolidation (Compression Mode)

Shift toward synthesis and clarity once sufficient material is gathered:

* “Distill the most stable and recurring principles from the gathered material.”
* “Group overlapping ideas into categories or clusters.”
* “Summarize this domain at the optimal level of conceptual granularity for integration.”

### 4. Reflection and Quality Control

Ensure coherence, traceability, and alignment:

* “Evaluate which parts of this synthesis are most strongly supported by literature.”
* “Where does conceptual ambiguity remain?”
* “What definitions or mechanisms would benefit from clearer differentiation?”

## Oversight Cues

* **Check for Evidence:** Confirm that key assertions or ideas can be traced to real literature.
* **Detect Over-Synthesis:** Be alert for false coherence or excessive generalization.
* **Maintain Framing Alignment:** Ensure exploration continues to serve the inquiry goals.
* **Use Iterative Refinement:** Alternate between expansion and compression rounds to gradually stabilize clarity.

## Key Reminder

The practitioner’s role is to **curate understanding**, not outsource it. The model assists in organizing and articulating knowledge, but epistemic judgment, framing, and validation remain human responsibilities.
